# Relational Integration Task - Exact Replication

**A faithful implementation of Chuderski (2013)'s groundbreaking study on relational integration and fluid reasoning.**

> Chuderski, A. (2013). The relational integration task explains fluid reasoning above and beyond other working memory tasks. *Memory & Cognition, 42*(3), 448-463. https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-013-0366-x

## Overview

This web application provides an **exact replication** of all three experiments from Chuderski (2013)'s seminal study on relational integration - the cognitive process shown to be the strongest predictor of fluid intelligence among all working memory measures.

### Why This Matters

This study fundamentally changed our understanding of the relationship between working memory and intelligence by showing that:
- **Relational integration** (binding representations into structures) predicts fluid IQ better than storage capacity or attention control
- Performance depends on the **number of bindings** required, not the number of objects or amount of interference
- The relational integration task explains **5.9% unique variance** in fluid reasoning - more than any other WM measure

## ✅ Exact Replication Features

This implementation faithfully replicates every detail from the original study:

### Core Task Elements
- ✅ 3×3 grid of three-character strings
- ✅ 10 consonants (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M) for letter trials
- ✅ 10 digits (0-9) for number trials
- ✅ Exactly 5.5 seconds per trial
- ✅ 0.1 second blink between trials
- ✅ **Trial persistence**: 1-4 strings carry over from previous trial
- ✅ Focus on last character of each string
- ✅ Space bar response
- ✅ 50% relation trials, 50% no-relation trials
- ✅ Accuracy scoring: Hit Rate - False Alarm Rate

### Pattern Detection Rules
- ✅ **Three-Same**: 3 identical endings in row/column (NO diagonals)
- ✅ **Five-Same**: 5 identical endings in cross or T pattern
- ✅ **Three-Different**: 3 different endings in row/column (NO diagonals)
- ✅ **Five-Different**: 5 different endings in cross or T pattern

### Experiment 1: Between-Subjects (N=112 in study)
**Purpose**: Test if bindings (not objects) determine difficulty

**Protocol**:
- Participant chooses ONE condition
- 5 training trials (letters only)
- 50 letter test trials
- 50 number test trials (no training)

**Expected Results**:
- Three-Same: 0.73 accuracy (2 bindings)
- Five-Same: 0.73 accuracy (2 bindings)
- Three-Different: 0.38 accuracy (3 bindings)
- Five-Different: 0.18 accuracy (5-10 bindings)

**Key Finding**: Same vs. different endings matter; number of objects doesn't (when bindings are equal).

### Experiment 2: Within-Subjects + Interference (N=40 in study)
**Purpose**: Test interference effects on performance

**Protocol**:
- Both Three-Same AND Five-Same conditions (randomized order)
- 10 training trials per condition (numbers only)
- 60 number test trials per condition
- 60 letter test trials per condition
- 50% low-interference, 50% high-interference trials

**Expected Results**:
- No significant effect of interference (low: 76%, high: 77%)
- Three-Same ≈ Five-Same (both ~73%)

**Key Finding**: Relational integration depends on binding processes, not interference resolution.

### Experiment 3: Multiple Conditions (N=243 in study)
**Purpose**: Compare predictive power for fluid reasoning

**Protocol**:
- Three conditions: Three-Same, Five-Same, Three-Different
- Three-Same always first, others randomized
- 40 number trials per condition (always first)
- 40 letter trials per condition (always second)
- NO training trials (to save time in long session)

**Expected Results**:
- All three conditions strongly predict fluid IQ (r ≈ .43-.48)
- No significant differences between conditions
- Relational integration > complex span > STM > n-back > antisaccade

**Key Finding**: Relational integration capacity is THE fundamental predictor of fluid reasoning.

## 🧠 Experimental Training Modes

**NEW!** In addition to the exact study replications, this implementation includes **9 experimental training modes** designed to potentially enhance fluid intelligence through various cognitive training strategies.

> **Important Scientific Note**: Evidence for "far transfer" (training on one task improving general intelligence) is limited and controversial in cognitive science. These modes are experimental and provided for exploration and research purposes. The strongest evidence is for near transfer (getting better at the specific task itself).

### Available Experimental Modes

#### 1. **Adaptive Difficulty Mode** 🎯
- **Method**: AI-adjusted challenge level based on real-time performance
- **How it works**:
  - Starts at 3 objects, 6 seconds per trial
  - If 80%+ accuracy: increase difficulty (more objects or less time)
  - If <60% accuracy: decrease difficulty
  - Maximum: 7 objects, 3 seconds
- **Evidence**: Adaptive training keeps learners at optimal challenge level (Zone of Proximal Development)
- **Session**: 50 trials with continuous adaptation

#### 2. **Progressive Complexity Training** 📈
- **Method**: 4-week structured progression program
- **Weekly Protocol**:
  - **Week 1**: 3 objects, 7s, clean grids (30 trials)
  - **Week 2**: Mixed 3-5 objects, 6s (40 trials)
  - **Week 3**: 5 objects, 5.5s, interference (50 trials)
  - **Week 4**: 7 objects, 5s, high interference (60 trials)
- **Evidence**: Gradual scaffolding matches natural skill acquisition
- **Progress**: Automatically saved between sessions

#### 3. **Speed-Accuracy Training** ⚡
- **Method**: Train rapid pattern detection under time pressure
- **4 Modes**:
  - **Accuracy Priority**: Unlimited time (focus on correctness)
  - **Balanced**: 5.5 seconds (original study timing)
  - **Speed Priority**: 3 seconds (rapid processing)
  - **Blitz Mode**: 2 seconds (extreme speed)
- **Evidence**: Processing speed highly correlated with fluid intelligence (r ≈ .50)
- **Session**: 40 trials per mode

#### 4. **Multi-Relational Integration** 🎨
- **Method**: Track TWO pattern dimensions simultaneously
- **Task**:
  - Detect number patterns (last character, as usual)
  - PLUS detect color patterns (colored dots on cells)
  - Press SPACE if EITHER pattern is present
- **Evidence**: Higher relational complexity = better Gf predictor (binding hypothesis)
- **Session**: 50 trials with dual tracking

#### 5. **Dual N-Back Hybrid** 🔄
- **Method**: Combine relational integration + n-back memory
- **Primary Task**: Detect patterns (standard relational integration)
- **Secondary Task**: Does current grid match N trials back?
- **Progression**: Automatic advancement from 1-back → 2-back → 3-back
- **Evidence**: Dual n-back training has some (controversial) evidence for IQ gains
- **Session**: 60 trials with progressive difficulty

#### 6. **Interference Management** 🛡️
- **Method**: Progressive distractor resistance training
- **4 Levels**:
  - **Level 1**: Clean grids (baseline)
  - **Level 2**: Visual noise with similar symbols
  - **Level 3**: Partial conflicting patterns
  - **Level 4**: High interference + time pressure (4s)
- **Evidence**: Trains selective attention and inhibitory control (executive functions)
- **Session**: 40 trials per level

#### 7. **Working Memory Load Variation** 💾
- **Method**: Manipulate trial-to-trial persistence
- **4 Modes**:
  - **Easy**: 4 items always carry over (low WM load)
  - **Medium**: 1-4 items carry over (original study)
  - **Hard**: 0-1 items carry over (high WM load)
  - **Extreme**: All new items every trial (maximum load)
- **Evidence**: WM capacity training may strengthen cognitive resources
- **Session**: 50 trials per mode

#### 8. **Meta-Cognitive Training** 🧘
- **Method**: Self-monitoring + strategy development
- **Features**:
  - Rate confidence (1-5) after each trial
  - Track calibration (confidence vs. accuracy alignment)
  - Receive strategy tips when struggling
  - Build metacognitive awareness
- **Evidence**: Metacognition improves learning across domains
- **Session**: 40 trials with confidence ratings

#### 9. **Gamified Progress System** 🏆
- **Method**: Long-term motivation and engagement tracking
- **Features**:
  - Daily streak tracking (current & longest)
  - Performance graphs over time
  - 5 Badge levels: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond
  - Session history and statistics
  - Progress persistence via localStorage
- **Evidence**: Sustained engagement crucial for training effectiveness (adherence)
- **Access**: Dashboard available anytime from main menu

### Using Experimental Modes

1. **Select a mode** from the "Experimental Training Modes" section on the welcome screen
2. **Configure settings** (where applicable, e.g., speed mode, WM load)
3. **Complete training session** (30-60 trials depending on mode)
4. **View results** including mode-specific metrics
5. **Track progress** automatically saved to Gamified Progress dashboard

### Scientific Recommendations

**For maximum cognitive benefit**:
1. **Start with Adaptive Mode** (strongest theoretical foundation)
2. **Add Progressive Complexity** for long-term engagement
3. **Use Gamified Progress** to maintain motivation
4. **Train consistently** (research shows 20+ sessions needed for effects)
5. **Combine multiple modes** rather than relying on just one

**Realistic Expectations**:
- ✅ You WILL improve at the specific task (near transfer)
- ⚠️ Transfer to general fluid IQ is uncertain (controversial evidence)
- ⚠️ Requires sustained practice (weeks/months, not days)
- ⚠️ Individual differences in training response
- ✅ May provide cognitive engagement and mental exercise benefits regardless

## Implementation Details

### Exact Technical Specifications

#### Trial Persistence (Critical Detail)
The study states: *"1-4 strings in each subsequent array were the same as in the preceding array"*

**Our Implementation**:
- After first trial, randomly select 1-4 positions
- Copy those strings from previous grid to current grid
- This reduces visual processing load between trials

## Scientific Background

### What is Relational Integration?

Relational integration is the cognitive process of binding mental representations and integrating them into complex relational structures. Unlike:
- **Storage capacity**: How many items you can hold
- **Attention control**: How well you can focus
- **Processing speed**: How fast you process

Relational integration measures:
- **Binding construction**: Creating temporary links between representations
- **Binding maintenance**: Keeping multiple bindings active
- **Binding integration**: Combining bindings into structured wholes

### The Binding Hypothesis

**Why does three-different require more bindings than three-same?**

**Three-Same** (e.g., X, X, X):
- Compare first and second → "both X" → Bind [position1-position2, value X]
- Compare third to binding → "also X" → Extend binding
- **Total: 2 bindings** (incremental comparison possible)

**Three-Different** (e.g., X, Y, Z):
- X vs Y → "different" → Bind [pos1-pos2, different]
- Y vs Z → "different" → Bind [pos2-pos3, different]
- X vs Z → "different" → Bind [pos1-pos3, different]
- **Total: 3 bindings** (all pairs must be compared)

**Five-Different** (e.g., V, W, X, Y, Z in cross pattern):
- All pairwise comparisons: 10 item-item bindings
- OR: 5 item-context bindings (binding each to its role in the pattern)
- **Total: 5-10 bindings** (dramatically exceeds WM capacity)

### Key Findings Summary

| Measure | Unique Variance in Fluid IQ |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Relational Integration** | **5.9%** ⭐ |
| Complex Span | 2.9% |
| STM Span | 0.4% |
| Antisaccade | 0.2% |
| N-back | ~0% |

**Shared variance** (all 4 measures + relational integration): 24.4%

### Implications

1. **For Intelligence Research**: Relational integration is a fundamental cognitive primitive that underlies fluid reasoning more than storage or control.

2. **For WM Theory**: Standard WM tasks (spans, n-back) may work because they require binding, not just storage.

3. **For Training**: If transfer to Gf is possible, training relational integration (not just memory span) may be most effective.

4. **For Assessment**: This task could be a more direct measure of reasoning potential than traditional WM tests.

## Validation

### How to Know It's Working

**Expected Pattern of Results**:
1. Three-same ≈ Five-same ≈ 0.73 (similar despite more objects)
2. Three-different ≈ 0.38 (harder despite fewer objects)
3. Five-different ≈ 0.18 (floor effect)
4. No effect of interference in Exp. 2
5. All conditions in Exp. 3 should feel effortful but doable

### Common Issues

**Too easy?**
- Check you're responding only to exact patterns (rows/columns for 3-object, cross/T for 5-object)
- Make sure you're checking the LAST character only
- Are you seeing the full 5.5 seconds?

**Too hard?**
- Make sure you understand the specific pattern for your condition
- Start with training trials
- Three-same is easiest - try that first
